### Document Your Computer Configuration, Part 1

By: Phil Davis

You just got a brand new Mac for Christmas but before you start using it, you might want to take a few minutes to look at your computer's basic configuration. You should save this information so that you will have a better chance of solving one of those vexing problems that will inevitably crop up.

Start by creating a folder called _Computer Configuration Information_ in Documents. This is where you will save the files and other information that you are going to collect. You can also use a program like Devonthink, MacJournal, or Evernote to save the information. Using one of these apps as a [Personal Knowledge Library][pkl] is a smart thing to do since they all have powerful search capabilities.

#### Use _About This Mac_

If you click the Apple icon in the upper left corner and select *About This Mac,* you will open a window that shows some of the basics -- the version of the operating system, the processor type and speed, the amount of memory, and the name of the start-up disk. Grab a quick screenshot of this window and save it in your _Configuration Information_ folder for future reference. If you have forgotten how to do this refresh your memory with [this tutorial][screenshot].

If you select the *Storage* tab at the top of the window you will get information about how much space is left on your startup drive and how it is used. You can also use the _Manage_ button to dive into the details of your storage. Grab screenshots and add them to your collection.

If you click on *Support* you can download a PDF copy of your computer's manual (1) and spec sheet (2). Your serial number will be used to get the correct information. Be sure to add these documents to your growing collection.

#### Use the free _MachineProfile_ App

An easier way to capture your computer specifications is to use the free [MachineProfile][machineprofile] app. After installing the app, select the _System Info_ tab.

Save the information in a text file by using **File > Save as Text** from the MachineProfile menu and put it in your _Configuration Information_ folder.

#### Get Information about Your Laptop Battery

You can also use MachineProfile to get information about the state of your laptop battery. Select the _Battery Info_ tab, then save it as a text file using **File > Save as Text**.

#### Get MacTracker

One final source of general information is a free app called [MacTracker][mactrackersite].
